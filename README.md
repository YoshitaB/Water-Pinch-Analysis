**AI-based Pinch Analysis and Utility Optimization for Refinery Energy Networks**

This project investigates energy optimization strategies in refinery operations by automating pinch analysis using Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to develop a semi-automated intelligent tool that reduces expert intervention, streamlines energy loop detection, and enables smarter resource management in large-scale refinery networks.

**🚀 Project Objectives**

-Automate pinch analysis to identify heat recovery opportunities in refinery energy systems.

-Build a semi-automated system that extracts heat exchanger loops directly from PFDs and P&IDs.

-Leverage LLMs and object-oriented machine learning for process data interpretation and loop detection.

-Demonstrate applicability in real refinery settings for utility optimization and cost reduction.

🔧 **Workflow Overview**

- Input Data: PFDs, P&IDs, and DCS data.

- Heat Exchanger Loop Detection: Identify loops from process diagrams.

- Automated Data Extraction: Parse tags, streams, exchangers, and P&IDs.

- Pinch Analysis Engine: Perform pinch calculations with minimal expert input.

- LLM-based Automation: Use AI models for structured parsing and intelligent recommendation.

- Output: Pinch analysis report highlighting utility savings and optimization strategies.
